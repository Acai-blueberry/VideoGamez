<p><mark>  Today, gaming is becoming a rising influenece to many people , from new games such as fort night and pub g-
  which is slowly becoming the "face" of the video game industry while a bonanza of amazingly
  executed games are underrated.
  From the video games that I have played thus far, video games are much more than shooting and killing people on
  a platform which robs children of clear morals and that someone may get addicted to but to
  view them as life lessons that adults,teens and children can learn from and that represent a shift from the
  past to the nearing future.
  Parents and families, along with other people who are in presence around video games,
  need to regard games as a medium which has multifaceted uses rather than only one or two.

  Continuning, video games are  currently used not only in entertainment,
  but also implemented in medicine, psychiatry training sessions, tools for soldiers to simulate real
  combat and even placebo means in hospitals etc..In terms of communication and perception, as aforementioned, video games acts
  as an indispensable means to a medium by encouraging all sorts of discussions and perceptual alterations.
  The various uses of games cannot be overstated, and most of them have profound impacts in different sections of our society.

Gaming-,well techincally, the choice narratives within games are technologies that structure our
thoughts when as we play these games. In this way, they are like many other entertainment mediums.
But one of the coolest things that’s unique to gaming is that, as the art form evolves,
games are beginning to play us. Games confront us with consequences in a way that other
technologies of this sort have only poked at. And while gaming is not even yet at the level
of interactive sophistication many imagine down the line, it’s easy to see games today that
would make some current eight-year-old’s head explode with intellectual
 revelations via buttons or keys. <br></p>
